# React-Redux with Redux-Sagas: Movie Sagas

The React-Redux with Redux-Sagas project is an extension of a movie management application. The objective is to add a detailed view for each individual movie, including all associated genres. This project emphasizes the transition from a movie list to viewing more information about a single movie, following a common pattern in web applications.

## Database Setup

1. Create a database named `saga_movies_weekend`.
2. Run the SQL queries from the `database.sql` file on the `saga_movies_weekend` database to set up the required tables and data.

## Installation and Setup

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

2. Install project dependencies by running the command:

npm install

sql


3. Start the server with the following command:

npm run server

sql


4. Start the client with the following command:

npm run client

sql


## Features

### Home / List Page

The Home/List Page is already completed and displays all movies in the movie database.

- **To-Do**: Clicking on a movie poster should navigate the user to the `/details` view for that specific movie.

### Details Page

The Details Page displays all details, including all genres, for the selected movie. It includes the movie title, description, and image. Redux-Sagas and Redux are used to handle data requests and management.

- **To-Do**: Implement a "Back to List" button on the Details Page to navigate the user back to the Home/List Page.

### General Considerations

- Styling: Invest time in styling the application, including cards for movie posters on the list page and a grid layout for movie posters on the Movie List page.
- Commits: Commit code frequently with descriptive commit messages.
- Comments: Add comments to your code for clarity.
- Documentation: Update this README with a description of the project in your own words.

## Development Accomplishments

Upon completing the React-Redux with Redux-Sagas project, the following developer accomplishments were achieved:

- Developed a detailed view feature for individual movies, including title, description, and associated genres.
- Utilized Redux-Sagas and Redux to manage data requests and state.
- Enhanced user interactions by implementing navigation between the Home/List Page and Details Page.
- Invested time in styling the application for improved visual appeal.
- Maintained a well-structured codebase with frequent commits and clear comments.
- Demonstrated proficiency in React, Redux, Redux-Sagas, and database setup.

These accomplishments reflect the successful expansion of the movie management application and the application of web development best practices.
